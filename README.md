# Alex The Analyst Bootcamp
This repository contains the portfolio project I made whilst completing the Alex The Analyst's Bootcamp on Youtube. Additional projects will be uploaded soon :)

# SQL
The SQL project was completed using a Mac and so, I used MySQL Workbench. Some of the code was adapted to MySQL Workbench for the code to work. Where there were problems I ran into I made comments to solve them by creating alternative strings of code.

# Excel
For the Excel project, we created a dashboard on bike sales and as can be seen below. The aim from this point is to build more Excel dashboards to expand my current skill set.

# Tableau
For the Tableau project, we created a dashboard showing the 2016 Seattle Airbnb data. My plan is to visualise a different dataset to focus more on current years and this will be done in the future.
